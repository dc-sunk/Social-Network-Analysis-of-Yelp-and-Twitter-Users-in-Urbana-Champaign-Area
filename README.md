## Abstract
Social similarity is critical in the formation of friendship. The purpose of this project is to test the well-established sociological hypothesis that people tend to be similar to their friends on social media. Yelp and Twitter were chosen as platforms to collect data for network analysis. Usersâ€™ following information on Twitter and reviewing profile on Yelp are used as main characteristics for calculating similarity. Group detection was conducted on Gephi using the Louvain method. Network properties of people grouped with different similarities were compared and the impact of node property on graph property were discussed. It was found that the similarity of users who are friends are much higher than users who are not friends on both Twitter and Yelp. Interest has significant impact on network properties.
